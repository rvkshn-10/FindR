# Git after task

When you finish a task that modified or added files in the workspace:

1. **Stage** the relevant changed files: `git add` (e.g. `git add -A` or specific paths). Do not add ignored or environment-specific files (e.g. `.env`, `.firebaserc` if the user keeps it local) unless the user asked to.
2. **Commit** with a short, descriptive message: `git commit -m "Brief description of changes"`.
3. **Do not push** to GitHub unless the user explicitly asks. They will say when to push.

Run stage and commit yourself as part of completing the task. Do not run git push or deploy to Firebase unless the user asks.
