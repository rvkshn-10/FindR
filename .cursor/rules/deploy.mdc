# Deployment

- **Do not** deploy to Firebase or push to GitHub automatically. Only run deploy or push when the user explicitly asks (e.g. "deploy to Firebase", "push to GitHub").
- When the user asks to deploy: from the project root run **`npm run deploy:firebase:flutter`** (builds Flutter web and deploys to Firebase Hosting). If they ask to push to GitHub, run `git push` as requested.
- If deploy fails due to auth (e.g. firebase login), suggest they run `firebase login` once from `findr_flutter/`.
