# Deployment

When the task involves deployment or results in deployable changes (e.g. Flutter web app, Firebase Hosting):

- **Run the deploy command** from the project root. For the **FindR Flutter app** (findr_flutter/), use: **`npm run deploy:firebase:flutter`** (builds Flutter web and deploys to Firebase Hosting).
- **Do not** tell the user to "run deploy yourself" or "run this from your terminal"—execute deploy as part of completing the task.
- If deploy fails due to auth (e.g. firebase login), inform the user to run `firebase login` once from `findr_flutter/`; after that, continue to run deploy when relevant.
