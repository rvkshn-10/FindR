# Deployment

When the task involves deployment or results in deployable changes (e.g. static build, Firebase Hosting):

- **Run the deploy command** (`npm run deploy:firebase` or `next build && firebase deploy`) from the project root.
- **Do not** tell the user to "run deploy yourself" or "run this from your terminal"—execute deploy as part of completing the task.
- If deploy fails due to auth (e.g. firebase login), then inform the user and suggest they run the auth step once; after that, continue to run deploy when relevant.
